# Ark-Patcher
Automatically adds a few patches that improve the performance, stability and change how the game feels.

## How to use it
Once you run the program and accept the license agreement, a new "config.json" file will be generated in the same directory in which the program is in.
All you need to do is input your ark path, and enable the patches you want.
It has a few brief descriptions of each patch and shows you where the source of the patch was (the link)

### IMPORTANT:
DO NOT remove "BaseScalability.ini", "Engine.ini", "BaseEngine.ini", "DefaultEngine.ini" from the same folder the program is running in! That will cause crashes and / or bugs.
This happens because the program reads those files and copy's them to your ark folder!
